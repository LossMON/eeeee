	Delete With Undo v1 by angeld23
	
	Default keybinds:
	[Right Click + Left Ctrl] - Deletes part that your mouse is pointing at.
	[Right Click + X] - Undo last deletion. Can be repeated until all parts are returned.
	[Right Click + C] - Undo all deletions. This will return every part at once.
	
	(You cannot hold the key and then right click, you must hold right click first. If anyone can fix that, it would be highly appreciated!)
	
	Set custom keybinds in the settings below.
	
	Report any bugs to angeld23 on v3rm (or Synapse Forums).
